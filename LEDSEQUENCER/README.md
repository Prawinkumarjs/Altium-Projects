# LED SEQUENCER Project

This project was created using Altium Designer ECAD software with the help of the [BinaryUpdate YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BINARYUPDATES) and the [Robert Feranec YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RobertFeranec). I express my gratitude for their excellent teaching.

## Project Features

### Learning Altium Basics
Understanding the user interface and essential tools.

### Schematic Design
Creating and editing schematics for electronic circuits.

### Design Verification
Checking for errors and optimizing the design for manufacturing.

## Output Files

### BOM (Bill of Material)
A BOM is a comprehensive list of parts, items, assemblies, and other materials required to create a product. It includes information such as part numbers, descriptions, quantities, and specifications.

### Gerber Files
Gerber files are used to describe the PCB images: copper layers, solder masks, and legend layers. These files are essential for the fabrication of the PCB.

### NC Drill Files
NC (Numerical Control) drill files provide the drilling data for the PCB. They specify the exact locations and sizes of the holes that need to be drilled.

### Composite Drawing
Composite drawings combine multiple layers of the PCB into a single view, showing how they are stacked and aligned.

### Draftsman
Draftsman documents provide detailed drawings and notes for manufacturing and assembling the PCB.

### Assembly Drawing
Assembly drawings show the placement of components on the PCB and provide instructions for assembling the final product.

### Pick and Place Files
Pick and place files provide data for automated machines to place components accurately on the PCB during assembly.


### Design Rule Checking (DRC)
DRC is a critical feature in Altium that checks your design against a set of predefined rules to ensure manufacturability and functionality. It helps identify potential issues such as short circuits, clearance violations, and signal integrity problems.

### Net Classes and Routing
Net classes allow you to group nets with similar characteristics and apply specific design rules to them. This is useful for high-speed signal routing, power distribution, and differential pairs.

### Layer Stack Management
Altium allows for the management of complex layer stacks, including multiple signal, power, and ground layers. This helps in designing multi-layer PCBs with better signal integrity and power distribution.

## Conclusion
This project has helped me gain a better understanding of Altium Designer and the complete process of designing and verifying a PCB. The tutorials from BinaryUpdate and Robert Feranec have been invaluable in my learning journey.
