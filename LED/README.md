# LED  Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a simple LED  using Altium Designer. The project was completed with the guidance of [Robert Feranec's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@RobertFeranec), which provided valuable insights into PCB design.

## Project Overview

- **Software Used:** Altium Designer
- **Project Name:** LED
- **Tutorial Reference:** [Robert Feranec YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/user/robertferanec)
 
- **Design Files:**
    - Schematic
    - PCB Layout
    - 3D Model

## Output Files

The following files have been generated and included in this repository:

- **Gerber Files:** Used for PCB manufacturing.
      
- **Bill of Materials (BOM):** Lists all components used in the project.

- **NC Drill Files:** Used for drilling holes in the PCB.

- **PDF Schematic:** A PDF version of the schematic for easy reference.

- **3D PDF:** A 3D PDF file for visualizing the PCB layout in 3D.

- **3D STEP File:** A 3D model of the PCB.
- **Assembly Drawings:** Detailed drawings for PCB assembly.
- **Pick and Place Files:** Files for automated component placement.


## Project Highlights

- **Custom Footprint, Schematic, and 3D Model**: The footprints, schematic, and 3D model for this project were created entirely by myself.
- **Output Files**: The project was successfully completed, and all essential output files, including Gerber, BOM, and more, were generated.
