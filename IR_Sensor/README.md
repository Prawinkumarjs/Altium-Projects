# IR Sensor Design - Altium Project

## Overview
This project focuses on designing an Infrared (IR) sensor using **Altium Designer**. The sensor detects proximity and measures distance using infrared light emission and reflection.

### Features
- **High Sensitivity**: Accurate detection of nearby objects.
- **Compact Design**: Suitable for tight spaces.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Ideal for battery-powered devices.

## Components
- **IR Emitter**: Emits infrared light.
- **IR Receiver**: Detects reflected IR signals.
- **Amplifier**: Boosts weak signals.
- **Microcontroller**: Processes sensor data.

## Schematic and PCB Design
- Designed with **Altium Designer**.
- Uses a **2-layer PCB layout** for optimized performance.
- Placement and routing minimize signal noise.

## Usage
- **Proximity Sensors**: Detects nearby objects without physical contact.
- **Line Tracking Robots**: Guides navigation.
- **Automation Systems**: Triggers actions upon object detection.

## Installation
1. Download project files.
2. Open in **Altium Designer**.
3. Review the schematic and PCB layout.
4. Manufacture and assemble the PCB.
